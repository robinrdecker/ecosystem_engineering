An integrodifference equation model of ecosystem engineering plants and their response to shifts in environmental gradients

The file 'EcosystemEngineering.R' sources the files 'EcosystemEngineeringFunctions.R' and 'spartina.cpp' to numerically solve the integrodifference equation model and produce all of the plots in the manuscript.
